# Goal

---

## Goal of statistics

One goal of **statistics** is to make **inferences** about a **population** based on data in one or more **samples**.
- Population: the entire group we would like to make conclusions about (e.g., all people aged 15 and up in China, all pregnancies worldwide)
- Sample: specific group we have collected data from (e.g., a random sample of non-institutionalized people aged 15 and up in sampled households, from sampled villages from sampled counties; pregnancies receiving prenatal care at Duke)
- The validity of our inferences depends on a variety of factors, including the **representativeness** of our sample

**Statistical inference** is built upon the foundation of **probability theory**.

### Data

We consider data from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS). Because of strongly gendered cultural norms around smoking in China, we will focus on smoking behavior as well as interviewer-identified binary gender.

### Data

## Selected variables

<br>

.midi[
variable        | description
----------------|-------------
`CURRENTSMOKE`      |	yes, no, or don't know
`AGE` |	computed from date of birth
`EDUCATION`	          | highest level of education completed
`GENDER`	          | interviewer instructions were "Record gender from observation. Ask if necessary"; options for male, female, missing/NA
`PROVINCE`       |	residence of the individual
]

Other data are also available in the file. Sample survey weights are not included but should be used to obtain nationally-representative estimates (our estimates are fairly close for the quantities we consider today).

# Operations on Events

---



## Events

An **event** is the basic element to which probability is applied, e.g. the result of an observation or experiment.

- **A** is the event that a person is a cigarette smoker
- **B** is the event that a person identifies as female
- **C** is the event that a person has blood type A+

A **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes.

---


## Operations on Events

- The **union** of A and B, denoted $A \cup B$, is the event that A, or B, or both A and B, occur. Here, $A \cup B$ is the event that a person identifies as female, or is a smoker, or both.

- The **intersection** of A and B, denoted $A \cap B$, is the event that both A and B occur. Here $A \cap B$ is the event that a person both identifies as female and is a smoker. A and B are **disjoint** or **mutually exclusive** if $A \cap B = \emptyset$ (A and B can't occur simultaneously).

- The **complement** of A, denoted $A^c$ or $\overline{A}$, is the event A does not occur (nonsmoker). $A$ and $\overline{A}$ are **mutually exclusive**

## Probability

The **probability** of an event tells us how likely an event is to occur, and it can take values from 0 to 1, inclusive. It can be viewed as the proportion of times the event would occur if it could be observed an infinite number of times.

If we know the probability of $A$, often denoted $P(A)$, it is easy to calculate the probability of $\overline{A}$ as $P(\overline{A})=1-P(A)$. 

---

## Additive Rule of Probability

When events are mutually exclusive, $P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)$.  When two events can occur simultaneously (think about runny nose in the Venn diagram), then we need to avoid double-counting when calculating the probability either of two events will occur. The general **additive rule of probability** is therefore $P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B)$ -- because $A \cap B$ is part of the event A and part of the event B, we need to avoid double-counting it.

---

## Conditional Probability

Often we wish to know the probabilty an event will occur given that another event will occur.  For example, instead of knowing the probability of contracting COVID, we may wish to know the probability that someone will contract COVID given that they have been vaccinated. This is an example of a **conditional probability**. The conditional probability that someone is a smoker (A) given that they identify as female (B) is denoted $P(A|B)$.

---

## Simple Example

Suppose we have a small set containing 3 female non-smokers, 1 female smoker, 4 non-female non-smokers, and 4 non-female smokers.

If we feel this set is a sample representative of a population of interest, we can **estimate** the probability someone is a smoker as $\frac{1+4}{3+1+4+4}=0.42$.

We may be interested in the conditional probability someone is a smoker given that they identify as female, which we can estimate as $\frac{1}{3+1}$ -- we just change the denominator to correspond to our smaller population of interest.

---

## Conditional Probability

More formally, we define **conditional probability** as 
$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$ (verify this on your own using the simple example figures).

Manipulating this formula, we get the **multiplicative rule of probability**: $P(A \cap B)=P(B)P(A|B)$.

One more helpful rule is the **law of total probability**:

$P(A)=P(A \mid B)P(B) + P(A \mid \overline{B})P(\overline{B}) = P(A \cap B)+P(A \cap \overline{B})$, which translates to the obvious statement that the probabilities that A occurs is equal to the sum of the probability that A occurs with B and that A occurs without B.

## Example: Breast Cancer Screening

Let $A$ be the event that a woman has breast cancer (e.g., background rate in population for a certain age group).  Say $P(A)=0.01$ for a 40-year-old woman.

Let $B$ be the event that a screening mammogram is positive.

Once a person has a positive mammogram, our estimate iof the probability she has breast cancer, $P(A|B)$, has increased.  How much should it increase?  Are we certain she has cancer, or is there some chance the test is wrong?

---

## Sensitivity and Specificity

A *diagnostic test* like a mammogram is often characterized by its quality -- we want a test to have good sensitivity (picking up cancer when a person really has it) and specificity (ruling out cancer when a person is cancer-free).

Sensitivity is $P(B|A)$, and specificity is $P(\overline{B} \mid \overline{A})$. A screening mammogram may have sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90%. 

---

## Bayes's Theorem

**Bayes's theorem** gives us a formal way to update our beliefs based on new information.  It says $P(A \mid B)=\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$. 

In this example, a 40 year old woman with a positive screening mammogram may wish to know her chances of having cancer. Several papers have shown that even doctors tend to strongly overestimate her chances of having cancer.

---

## Bayes's Theorem

- Baseline probability of cancer $P(A)=0.01$ (1 percent of women her age)
- She wants to know $P(A \mid B)$ or her chances of having cancer given that her mammogram is positive (also called **positive predictive value**).
- Bayes's Theorem: $P(A \mid B)=\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}$.  From the sensitivity above, we know $P(B \mid A)=0.85$. 
- How do we get $P(B)$?  We can get this using the law of total probability:  $P(B)=P(B \mid A)P(A) + P(B \mid \overline{A})P(\overline{A})$. 
  - We can get $P(B \mid \overline{A})$ using the specificity $P(\overline{B} \mid \overline{A})$ and the fact that $P(\overline{B} \mid \overline{A}+P(B \mid \overline{A})=1$ as $P(B \mid \overline{A})=1-0.9=0.1$ 
  - Then P(B)=0.85*0.01+0.1*0.99=0.1075

So finally $P(A \mid B)=\frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}=\frac{0.85*0.01}{0.1075}=0.079$.

## Bayes's Theorem and Baseline Prevalence

Here, we can think of the 1% probability of breast cancer among 40 year old women as our **prior probability** a woman has cancer, and 7.9% as the **posterior probability** she has cancer after we see the data that her screening mammogram is positive.

Cancer would be confirmed or ruled out by subsequent testing, such as a diagnostic mammogram, ultrasound, or biopsy. 

## You Try It!

Most people who have a negative test result (e.g., mammogram looks good or COVID test negative) don't then worry about whether they really do have disease. Suppose our 40 year old woman with a baseline 1% breast cancer risk instead had a negative (all clear) mammogram. What is the updated probability she has breast cancer given this test result?
